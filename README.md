# Guyana_landcover
These data and code represent a land cover classification for Campbelltown, Guyana. The land cover classification relied on a PlanetScope Image acquired on September 19th, 2019. Using the Large-Scale Mean-Shift algorithm (LSMS) in ORFEO Toolbox, Version 7.0, we segmented the image into objects. The all_objects.csv file represents the results of the segmentation analysis, including spectral properties and geometry of objects. We then used a training dataset of classified objects to develop a land cover classification. The landcover_training_data.csv file represents the training data set. Finally, the land_cover_classification_final.R file represents R code for running a Support Vector Machine to  predict land cover classes for the full dataset.
